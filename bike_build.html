			<p>I wanted a touring bike. My other bikes are fixed gear or singlespeed, so I wanted something with a decent gear range and a lot of luggage capacity. I started scrolling through Craigslist (my go-to for buying bikes). After a week or so, I came across this Univega Gran Touring.</p>

			<p>It looked a little rough, with an old school 3x6 drivetrain and a funky bullhorn bar setup, but it was a touring bike, it was my size, and it was cheap. I went to take a test ride, and despite a bent rear derailleur hanger and flat tires, I bought it. The frame looked solid and it fit well, and I knew I could fix the rest.<br></br>
			The first thing I knew I needed were new wheels. The old wheels had a lot of rust around the hubs and the bearings felt terrible. The bearings should be fixable, but the last straw was that the rear hub was made for a freewheel, and I wanted a more modern cassette for my build. I decided to go with a set of Shimano 105 hubs laced to Mavic Open Pro rims. Shimano’s 105 groupset is a mid-range road groupset, finding a good balance between performance, weight, and cost. I also bought some 32mm Gatorskin tires, the biggest size they offer. I already use Gatorskins on my fixed gear, but I went up in size to add some comfort to my ride. With a wider tire, you don’t have to pump it up quite so much, and that helps absorb impacts from the road.</p>

			<p>Next up was the drivetrain. I’ve been curious about 1x setups, which is a geared bike with only a single front chainring, for a while now. As a fixed gear rider I am a big fan of simplicity. With a 1x setup, you lose gear range, but you also get rid of the weight of an extra chainring, front derailleur, front shifter, and a shift cable. There’s also less adjustment and less to go wrong while on tour. I picked a Shimano 105 compact crankset, and replaced the two chainrings with a Raceface Narrow Wide 42t ring. Narrow wide chainrings alternate between narrow and wide teeth, matching the spacing in alternating chain links. This helps keep the chain from falling off the chainring, as there is no longer a front derailleur to hold it in place. I also installed an Ultegra Hollowtech II bottom bracket, which works with this crankset.</p>

		<div>
			<p>For the cassette, I went with a Shimano Deore 11-42 cassette. Deore is a mountain bike groupset. 11-42 is a much bigger gear range than you will find with any road cassette, and I needed a wide range cassette since I was only using one ring up front. With this setup, I was able to get a gear range from 27 to 103 gear inches. You get gear inches by multiplying your gear ratio by the diameter of your wheel with the tire on.<br></br>
			I went with a matching Deore rear derailleur and trigger shifter. The derailleur is what’s called a clutch derailleur. The clutch is basically a friction damper that makes it harder to pivot the derailleur cage. This added friction helps with chain slap, and along with the narrow wide teeth, will help prevent chain drop from the front chainring.</p>

		<div>
			<p>I got a pair of flat bar brake levers, since I was changing handlebars. These mountain bike style levers fit together nicely with the mountain bike style trigger shifter.</p>

			<p>The bike already had a new set of Avid Shorty cantilever brakes when I bought it, so I reused those with fresh cables.</p>

			<p>I knew I wanted touring bars that had lots of different hand positions, as your hands get tired in the same place on longer rides. I came across these Velo Orange Crazy Bars and had to try them out! They combine the outstretched bullhorn position I’m used to on my fixed gear bike with a more upright swept back position. I had to find a quill stem with a removable faceplate (2 bolt), since these bars can’t be slid in from the side. There weren’t a lot of options but I found this Profile Designs stem that does the job.</p>

			<p>Brooks saddles are legendary for touring comfort, and they look so classic. I bought one along with some matching Brooks bar tape to tie the look together.</p>

			<p>Finally, to carry my luggage, I added a few racks. I put on a water bottle cage and a Blackburn Outpost Cargo Cage, which can hold anything from a large Nalgene to a speaker to a camping pad. I also installed a Tubus Tara front rack to hold panniers for more capacity.<br></br>
			Add a few bags, and the Univega is ready for the road! Below are some pictures from tours I've done in Colorado, Utah, and Big Sur.</p>
