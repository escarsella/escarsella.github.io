			<p>I’m a bike commuter, so I ride my bike almost every day. I was getting sick of carrying my bikes up and down the stairs to my basement all the time, but there wasn’t a good place on the ground floor of my apartment to keep any bikes without getting in my roommates’ way. Our front entrance area is two stories tall, so there was a lot of unused space overhead.<br></br>
			I remembered seeing bike pulley systems for sale online, so I did some research. After looking at a few models, they all looked a little flimsy. I knew with a trip to Home Depot and a little bit of work I could build one that would be much sturdier.</p>

			<p>The rope starts tied to an eye loop screwed into the 2x4. It travels down to a pulley with a large carabiner attached. That carabiner is one of two that holds the bike. It’s important to have two connections to the bike so that it stays relatively level and doesn’t twist around when it’s hoisted.</p>

			<p>After this pulley, the rope travels up to another pulley that’s fixed into the 2x4. It then travels horizontally along the 2x4 to another fixed pulley. I spaced these the same distance apart as the bike’s handlebars and saddle. It would have worked with only one fixed pulley here, but it looks a lot neater with two. The rope then goes down to the second pulley/carabiner, and back up to the final pulley. I first used another fixed pulley here, but after testing it out realized that it forced you to stand directly underneath while lifting the bike up. I switched out the fixed pulley for one that attached to another eye loop. This allowed it to swing around in any direction, so the user can lift the bike from anywhere.</p>

			<p>Finally, I attached a boat cleat to the wall, so I can tie off the rope and keep the bikes held in place.<br></br>
			Besides holding up the bike in two places, this design is great because it gives the user a 4 to 1 mechanical advantage. This means you only have to lift up 1/4 of the bike’s weight (plus friction in the pulleys). This makes the system really easy to use for anybody. This project was quite useful as a space saver in my apartment, and I use it almost every day.</p>
